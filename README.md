## Instructions
1. Enter your Pool Size in D6
2. Enter your average 24 hour FC demand in D7
3. Enter your 24 hour FC output in D8. See [Discount Salt Pool SWG Comparison](https://www.discountsaltpool.com/Compare-Saltwater-Chlorine-Generator-Systems-for-Pools) for common SWG's "Power (lbs/day)".

You can adjust the "SWG Output %" to see how many hours you need to run to run your pump. You can type in a desired runtime to see what percent you need to set your SWG to. You can also look at the chart that shows the number of hours your pump needs to run based on percents in 5% increments and an FC demand between 1 and 5.
